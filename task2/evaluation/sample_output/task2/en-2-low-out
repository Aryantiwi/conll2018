estimated	_	_
that	_	_
Israel	_	_
arad	have	_
over	_	_
200	_	_
nuclear	_	_

yet	_	_
neither	_	_

Now	_	_
,	_	_
I	_	_
would	_	_
onter	argue	_
that	_	_
one	_	_
could	_	_
have	_	_
reasonably	_	_
perinint	predict	_
that	_	_
some	_	_

violence	_	_
was	_	_
likely	_	_
to	_	_
onoring	occur	_
in	_	_
Lebanon	_	_
(	_	_
considering	_	_
that	_	_
the	_	_
country	_	_
has	_	_
been	_	_
experiencing	_	_
some	_	_
form	_	_
of	_	_
poninining	conflict	_
for	_	_
approximately	_	_
the	_	_
last	_	_
32	_	_
years	_	_
)	_	_
.	_	_

In	_	_
other	_	_
onong	word	_
,	_	_
those	_	_
Americans	_	_
were	_	_
there	_	_
by	_	_
their	_	_
own	_	_
choice	_	_
,	_	_
perer	mire	_
in	_	_
a	_	_
situation	_	_
that	_	_
was	_	_
totally	_	_
predictable	_	_
.	_	_

Yet	_	_
we	_	_
did	_	_
n't	_	_
perter	charge	_
them	_	_
for	_	_
the	_	_
evacuation	_	_
.	_	_

This	_	_
is	_	_
unlike	_	_
the	_	_
situation	_	_
last	_	_
year	_	_
in	_	_
Asia	_	_
when	_	_
we	_	_
perinting	evacuate	_
U.S.	_	_
citizens	_	_
from	_	_
areas	_	_
that	_	_
were	_	_
tint	hit	_
by	_	_
the	_	_
tsunami	_	_
a	_	_
phenomenon	_	_
that	_	_
is	_	_
much	_	_
less	_	_
predictable	_	_
than	_	_
the	_	_

ononont	provoke	_

that	_	_

on	_	_

for	_	_

Brian	_	_

been	_	_
oner	one	_
of	_	_
the	_	_
most	_	_
crucial	_	_
elements	_	_
to	_	_
the	_	_

Now	_	_

pononting	confirm	_
by	_	_
Google	_	_
at	_	_
the	_	_

sere	time	_
,	_	_
but	_	_
it	_	_
's	_	_
an	_	_
old	_	_
adage	_	_
that	_	_
you	_	_
follow	_	_
the	_	_
money	_	_

who	_	_

In	_	_
this	_	_
case	_	_
,	_	_
following	_	_
the	_	_
talent	_	_

me	_	_
to	_	_

that	_	_

they	_	_

n't	_	_

up	_	_

anything	_	_
extraordinary	_	_

as	_	_
I	_	_
can	_	_
erer	see	_
in	_	_

Someone	_	_
in	_	_
the	_	_

ontin	sit	_
down	_	_

up	_	_

warrants	_	_
and	_	_
taad	take	_
in	_	_
people	_	_
like	_	_

This	_	_
is	_	_
either	_	_
gross	_	_
incompetence	_	_
or	_	_
was	_	_
ong	do	_
with	_	_
dark	_	_
ulterior	_	_

that	_	_
can	_	_
scarcely	_	_
be	_	_
ononter	guess	_
at	_	_

There	_	_
is	_	_
a	_	_
classical	_	_
logical	_	_
fallacy	_	_
,	_	_
post	_	_
hoc	_	_

propter	_	_
hoc	_	_
(	_	_
Z	_	_

ponter	cause	_
by	_	_
X	_	_
)	_	_
,	_	_
and	_	_
I	_	_
bere	keep	_
revising	_	_
this	_	_

this	_	_

because	_	_
I	_	_
do	_	_
n't	_	_

,	_	_
the	_	_

some	_	_
rock	_	_
will	_	_
be	_	_
ononter	remove	_
and	_	_
replaced	_	_
with	_	_

getting	_	_
quotes	_	_
to	_	_
ontin	put	_
up	_	_
new	_	_
rock	_	_
then	_	_
we	_	_
will	_	_

Several	_	_

what	_	_
is	_	_
called	_	_
a	_	_
substitution	_	_

It	_	_

They	_	_
do	_	_
n't	_	_

the	_	_

and	_	_
the	_	_

of	_	_
and	_	_
something	_	_
to	_	_
hopefully	_	_
fit	_	_
in	_	_
my	_	_

no	_	_
onte	pet	_
is	_	_
really	_	_
easy	_	_
to	_	_
take	_	_
cere	care	_
of	_	_
.	_	_

they	_	_
all	_	_
need	_	_
orer	love	_
and	_	_
attn	_	_
,	_	_
food	_	_
,	_	_
proper	_	_

the	_	_
easiest	_	_
thing	_	_
would	_	_
be	_	_
a	_	_
oring	fish	_
but	_	_
u	_	_
need	_	_
to	_	_
clean	_	_
the	_	_
tan	tank	_
weekly	_	_
,	_	_

araded	have	_
a	_	_
pet	_	_
is	_	_
n't	_	_
easy	_	_
.	_	_

You	_	_
should	_	_
treat	_	_
all	_	_
onte	pet	_
like	_	_
children	_	_
.	_	_

They	_	_
perining	require	_
a	_	_
lot	_	_
of	_	_
attention	_	_
or	_	_
they	_	_
get	_	_
fussy	_	_
and	_	_
teran	tear	_
stuff	_	_
up	_	_
.	_	_

If	_	_
you	_	_
want	_	_
easy	_	_
then	_	_
ong	go	_
with	_	_
a	_	_
gold	_	_
fish	_	_
or	_	_
hamster	_	_
.	_	_

I	_	_
would	_	_
ong	go	_
with	_	_
a	_	_

you	_	_
can	_	_
handle	_	_
and	_	_
oring	hold	_

pering	fish	_
are	_	_
probably	_	_
the	_	_
easiest	_	_
to	_	_

In	_	_
a	_	_

of	_	_
good	_	_
quality	_	_
,	_	_
the	_	_
